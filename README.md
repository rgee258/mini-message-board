# Mini Message Board

A miniature message board created using Express to get used to some of the functionalities it offers. Several parts of Express used for practice here include the Express generator, routes, and views.

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/mini-message-board).

## Usage

To run the application, first install the dependencies using **npm install**.

Then use **npm start** to start the application.

There are three possible url locations:

- localhost:3000
- localhost:3000/new

The index page will display a list of all of the messages that have been submitted.

Going to the new page will allow for form submission of a new message, which will then redirect you to the index to see your newly submitted message.
